package com.example.systemize.service;

public class UserServiceImpl {
//    This service will encapsulate the core business logic for user management.
//    It should include methods such as:
//    registerUser(UserRegistrationDto userData):
//    This method will take user registration data (e.g., username, password), hash the plain-text password using the configured PasswordEncoder,
//    create a new User entity, and save it to the database via the UserRepository.
//
//    findByUsername(String username): A method to retrieve a user from the database based on their username.
//
//    Challenge Consideration:
//    Correctly orchestrating the interaction between the controller, service, and repository layers.
//    A key challenge is ensuring that the raw, plain-text password from the registration request is hashed before the User entity is saved to the database.
//    It is also crucial to handle potential errors, such as a registration attempt with a username that already exists.
